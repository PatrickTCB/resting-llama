# Lazy Llama

It's an extremely basic REST wrapper around an Ollama server. I use it to be able to very easily get small amounts of ML text into other projects. And via a siri shortcut so that I can ask my HomePod questions and have a chance at getting an answer other than "I found some web results. I can show you if you ask again from your iPhone.".
